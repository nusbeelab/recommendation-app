<p>We will randomly select one of your 13 choices and implement the choice in Part 3. For example, in the randomly
  chosen
  one, suppose you choose “Receive recommendations. Receive $0.7”, you will receive recommendations in Part 3 plus an
  additional USD 0.7. Similarly, you choose “Receive no recommendations. Receive $0.2.”, you will NOT receive
  recommendations in Part 3, BUT you WILL receive USD 0.2.</p>
<p>Your best strategy is always to choose what you really prefer for each of the 13 choices.</p>
