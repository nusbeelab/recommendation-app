<p>In Part 3, there are 60 questions. In each question, you will be asked to choose between two options of payment.</p>
<p>Before answering these 60 questions, you will be asked whether to receive recommendations for Part 3 like in Part 2.
</p>

<div class="qn-container">
  <div class="options">
    <div class="option">
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>Receive recommendations.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Receive $0.1.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <div class="option">
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>Receive no recommendations.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Receive $0.8.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="qn-btns">
    <div class="qn-btn-container">
      <div class="qn-btn">A</div>

<p>
  Both “Receive recommendations” and “Receive no recommendations” come with an additional monetary payment while amounts
  can vary. For example, if you choose “Receive recommendations. Receive $0.1.”, you will receive recommendations in
  Part
  3 plus an additional USD 0.1. If you choose “Receive no recommendations. Receive $0.8.”, you will NOT receive
  recommendations in Part 3, BUT you WILL receive USD 0.8.
</p>
<p>We will randomly select one of your 13 choices and implement the choice in Part 3. For example, in the randomly
  chosen
  one, suppose you choose “Receive recommendations. Receive $0.7”, you will receive recommendations in Part 3 plus an
  additional USD 0.7. Similarly, you choose “Receive no recommendations. Receive $0.2.”, you will NOT receive
  recommendations in Part 3, BUT you WILL receive USD 0.2.</p>
<p>Your best strategy is always to choose what you really prefer for each of the 13 choices.</p>
